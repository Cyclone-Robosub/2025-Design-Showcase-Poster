= About Us
Founded in 2023, Cyclone RoboSub is an engineering student design team at UC Davis developing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our interdisciplinary team of thirty is organized into six sub-teams and three divisions each tacking a different part of the project. The team will be competing for the first time and debuting our vehicle, Glormuth, at the RoboSub competition this August. 

= RoboSub Competition
The RoboSub Competition is an international underwater robotics competition where teams from around the world compete with custom autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Participating AUVs complete tasks such as manipulating objects, maneuvering, and firing torpedoes, all while operating without human input. 

= Strategy
Given that we will be competing for the first time this summer, we decided to take a very deliberate approach to competition strategy prioritizing simple, efficient solutions. Our team chose to focus on navigation based tasks while ignoring the majority of manipulation tasks which require active input from vision systems.

= Vehicle Design
Our vehicle was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. Four vertical thrusters and four 45#sym.degree angled horizontal thrusters allow for the full six degrees of freedom. The symmetric thruster layout simplifies vehicle control and maneuverability. The volume and mass of the is balanced making the AUV neutrally buoyant and the low center of mass creates a buoyancy moment which naturally rights the vehicle. 

All electronics are housed in a single acrylic tube with cables running to the exterior through Blue Robotics wetlink penetrators. The tube is held in place by hinged clasps printed from weather-resistant PETG and thrusters are mounted using CNC milled aluminum brackets.
